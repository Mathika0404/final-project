        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <div class="transparent-box">
          <p>As a passionate Front-End Developer, I specialize in creating visually appealing, user-centric websites and web applications. My journey in web development began with a deep curiosity for how websites work, which quickly evolved into a full-fledged career built on continuous learning and hands-on experience.

        I bring a strong command of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the table, along with experience in frameworks and libraries such as React.js and Bootstrap. My focus is always on delivering responsive, accessible, and performance-optimized interfaces that work seamlessly across devices and browsers.

        I believe that a great user experience starts with clean and efficient code. I'm proficient in using tools like Git, Figma, and Chrome DevTools, and I follow modern development practices including mobile-first design and version control.

        My goal is not just to build websites but to craft digital experiences that are intuitive, engaging, and impactful. Iâ€™m constantly exploring the latest trends and technologies in front-end development to ensure I stay at the forefront of the industry.
